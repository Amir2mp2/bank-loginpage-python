login to your account if it does exist in the MySQL database
hi, guys, this app contains a login panel and register panel which both of them works 
first you have to register yourself in the register panel,  when you filled the entries right the app will save the information in a table in MySQL
don't have the table or the database?  that's ok when you run the app it will automatically create a database and a table in it if it does not exist
